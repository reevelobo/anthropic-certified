# Images, PDFs, and high-volume processing

Up to now you've been managing what Claude remembers between turns. Multimodal ingestion shifts the question to what you're sending in: every image and PDF consumes context budget before Claude reads a single character of your prompt, which changes how you structure requests and what you can fit in one. The second half of this topic deals with the opposite end of the same problem. When you have thousands of inputs to process, sending one request at a time and waiting for each response stops making sense, and the Batch API is how you handle that volume without blocking your application.

## Image token cost: Calculate before you commit

Images are not free in terms of context budget. Claude views images in patches: each 28×28-pixel block of the image is one visual token, so an image costs ⌈width / 28⌉ × ⌈height / 28⌉ visual tokens. A 1,000 × 1,000 pixel image is ⌈1000/28⌉ × ⌈1000/28⌉ = 36 × 36 patches, about 1,296 visual tokens. At that rate, ten high-resolution screenshots consume as much context as a detailed system prompt. Each model also has a maximum native image resolution, expressed as a long-edge limit and a visual-token limit, and these limits differ by model tier. The newest models accept substantially larger images than the standard tier. Images larger than either limit are downscaled before processing, so the formula runs on the scaled dimensions. Confirm the current per-tier limits against the Vision page (Resolution and token cost) at build time; the limits have changed between model generations and will again.

The calculation matters at design time. If you are building a pipeline that processes images, measure the token cost of a typical production image against your model's context limit before you write the ingestion code. The fix for an over-budget pipeline is often a ten-minute image resize step. If you discover this after deployment, it takes even longer.

## Different ways to send an image: When each is right

### **Inline base64**

**How it works:** Encode the image bytes as a base64 string and include the data directly in the message block.

**Overhead:** The full encoded payload travels with every request, which inflates request size and counts against latency on large images.

**When to use:** Best for one-off images where adding an upload step would add complexity without a payoff. The same image sent repeatedly multiplies the cost, so reach for a different method if reuse is likely.

### **URL reference** 
**How it works:** Pass a publicly reachable URL in the source block, and Claude fetches the image at request time.

**Overhead:** No payload travels with the request, but you take on the dependency that the URL must be stable, public, and reachable at the moment Claude tries to fetch it.

**When to use:** Best when the image is already hosted at a stable public URL you control. Skip it for anything behind auth, anything signed with a short expiry, or anything you can't guarantee will be reachable when the request runs.

### **Files API**
**How it works:** Upload the file once through a separate API call, receive a file_id, and reference that ID in any future message.

**Overhead:** The upload is a one-time cost; every later request carries the ID instead of the bytes, so payload overhead drops to near-zero from that point on. Currently in beta and not available on Bedrock or Vertex AI; verify availability for your deployment platform.

**When to use:** Best when the same image or PDF appears across multiple requests, or when the asset is large enough that re-sending it would dominate request size. Also, the cleanest choice when you want asset management to live separately from inference calls, and the right choice for images that appear across multiple conversation turns, since the file_id carries no payload weight as history grows.


## Sending PDFs: The `document` block

For PDFs, the block type is `document` rather than `image`.

The source structure follows the same pattern as images, which means it can be base64, a URL, or a Files API `file_id`.

There is no required `name` field on a document block. The block accepts an optional `title` field for a readable document name, and an optional `context` field for additional metadata, but neither is required to send a PDF.

All other mechanics, including token cost considerations and Files API reuse, apply in the same way.

```json
{
  "type": "document",
  "source": {
    "type": "base64",
    "media_type": "application/pdf",
    "data": "<base64-encoded-pdf-bytes>"
  },
  "title": "contract_review.pdf"
}
```

## Applying prompting techniques to multimodal inputs

The same prompting techniques from the first section apply to image and PDF analysis.

A bare "describe this image" prompt produces shallow output for the same reason a bare text prompt does, as Claude has no target structure to aim for.

The difference is that images carry ambiguity that text cannot, which includes:

- Overlapping objects
- Depth and spatial relationships
- Partial occlusion

A prompt for visual analysis should name how Claude should handle each type of ambiguity.

> "If objects overlap, describe each separately and note the overlap"

is a concrete constraint that a text-only prompt would never need.

## The Message Batches API: High-volume asynchronous processing

When you need to run the same prompt pattern against hundreds or thousands of inputs, the synchronous API is the wrong model.

Each synchronous call blocks until complete. At scale, that means your application is either:

- Burning threads
- Running thousands of concurrent connections against rate limits

The Message Batches API accepts up to **100,000 requests or 256 MB** (whichever comes first) in a single batch call.

You submit the batch, receive a `batch_id`, and poll for completion. When the batch finishes, you download the results.

The per-token cost for batch requests is lower than for synchronous ones.

The tradeoff is latency: batch processing is non-deterministic and can take up to **24 hours**, often much faster.

The pattern suits:

- Offline pipelines
- Evaluation runs
- Data processing jobs

It does **not** suit real-time user interactions.

### Use Cases

| Use case | Right API pattern | Why |
|----------|-------------------|-----|
| A user uploads a photo and expects an immediate classification | Synchronous API | Real-time response is required. Batch latency is unacceptable for interactive use. |
| A nightly pipeline classifies 5,000 customer records | Message Batches API | Latency is not a constraint. Batch cost reduction and asynchronous processing are both valuable. |
| An evaluation run tests a new prompt against 2,000 examples | Message Batches API | Offline task with no real-time requirement. Batch is the correct pattern. |
| A chatbot generates a reply to a user's message | Synchronous API | User is waiting; batch would introduce unacceptable delay. |

## When multimodal and batch fit together, and when they don't

The combination works for offline workloads that reuse the same assets and need structured output across thousands of inputs.

A nightly pipeline classifying images against a fixed taxonomy is the textbook case:

- Files API removes redundant uploads
- Batches API absorbs the latency
- Structured-output techniques keep results machine-readable

### Two failure modes break the fit

1. **Misreading latency**

   Reaching for batch in any user-facing flow with an image produces a system that passes tests and fails in production, because the user is waiting and the batch isn't.

2. **Underestimating context cost**

   Images and PDFs consume budget before Claude processes any text, so pipelines loading multiple large images per request blow past token limits at scale.

   Measure token cost on production-scale inputs before you build.

# The batch job that was not actually a batch

## Setup

*Splitting a job into chunks and processing them one after another is not batching; it is serialization with extra steps. The Message Batches API exists for high-volume workloads precisely because looping over inputs against the synchronous API runs into rate limits the moment the volume gets real, no matter how you slice the input list.*

## An internal channel conversation about a nightly job that kept hitting rate limits

A developer has been re-running the same nightly classification job for three nights and keeps hitting rate-limit errors at around the same point each time. The senior developer asks one question that surfaces the actual problem.

**Developer:**  
"My nightly job keeps hitting rate limits. I've already split it into smaller chunks. What else can I do?"

**Senior Developer:**  
"How are you submitting them?"

**Developer:**  
"I'm looping over the list and calling the API for each item."

**Senior Developer:**  
"That is not batching. That is serial calls against the synchronous endpoint. Splitting the list into chunks does not change what the API sees: it still sees one request per item, back to back."

**Developer:**  
"So the rate limit is firing because I am making thousands of synchronous calls?"

**Senior Developer:**  
"Right. The Message Batch API takes up to 100,000 requests or 256 MB per batch in a single batch call, returns a `batch_id`, and processes them asynchronously. You poll for completion, which means your code repeatedly checks the status of the batch on a schedule until the API tells you it's done. The per-token cost is lower than synchronous, and the rate limit does not fire because you are not making thousands of individual requests."

**Developer:**  
"And the tradeoff?"

**Senior Developer:**  
"Latency is non-deterministic. Batch processing can take hours. If this were a real-time user interaction, it would be the wrong tool. However, this is perfect for a nightly classification run."

## What to Watch Out for

Chunking a list and looping over the synchronous API is not batching, even though it feels like it should be.

It produces the same number of API calls as the un-chunked version and runs into the same rate limits.

The Message Batches API is a different submission model, not a smaller batch size.

Use it whenever the workload is:

- High-volume
- Offline

Reach for the synchronous API only when a user is waiting on the other end.

Results return in arbitrary order, not the order requests were submitted in.

Use the `custom_id` field on each request to match results back to inputs.

# Checkpoint 8 · Select the right input encoding for each scenario

Read the three input scenarios below. For each input scenario, select the correct encoding method. Each item's feedback names the cost of the wrong choice.

---

## Scenario 1

### A reference product diagram used in every request your pipeline makes

**Options:**

- Message Batches API: submit all requests in one batch call, poll for completion
- Files API: upload once, reference `file_id` in each request
- Inline base64: encode and include directly in the message block

### ✅ Correct Answer

**Files API: upload once, reference `file_id` in each request**

### Technical Reasoning

The same asset is being reused across many requests. Uploading the diagram once to the Files API and referencing it by `file_id` eliminates redundant uploads and reduces request size.

Benefits:

- Upload once, reuse many times
- Reduces bandwidth usage
- Reduces request payload size
- Improves efficiency at scale
- Ensures consistent file references across requests

### Why the Other Options Are Wrong

#### ❌ Message Batches API

The Message Batches API is designed for asynchronous processing of large numbers of requests. It does not solve the problem of repeatedly uploading the same file.

#### ❌ Inline base64

Encoding the same diagram in every request causes:

- Larger payloads
- Increased token consumption
- Additional bandwidth usage
- Higher cost at scale

### Key Learning

> Reusable assets should be uploaded once with the Files API and referenced using `file_id` in future requests.

---

## Scenario 2

### A one-off screenshot of a UI bug, submitted by a support engineer in a single request

**Options:**

- Message Batches API: submit all requests in one batch call, poll for completion
- Files API: upload once, reference `file_id` in each request
- Inline base64: encode and include directly in the message block

### ✅ Correct Answer

**Inline base64: encode and include directly in the message block**

### Technical Reasoning

The screenshot is being used only once and does not require reuse. Inline base64 encoding allows the image to be included directly in the request without first uploading it.

Benefits:

- Simplest implementation
- No extra upload step
- Ideal for single-use assets
- Faster integration path

### Why the Other Options Are Wrong

#### ❌ Files API

Using the Files API introduces an additional upload step that provides little or no benefit when the file will never be reused.

#### ❌ Message Batches API

This is a user-facing support workflow where a response is expected promptly. Batch processing introduces unnecessary latency and is intended for offline workloads.

### Key Learning

> For single-use images and documents, inline base64 is often the simplest and most appropriate choice.

---

## Scenario 3

### A job classifying 5,000 customer feedback responses

**Options:**

- Message Batches API: submit all requests in one batch call, poll for completion
- Files API: upload once, reference `file_id` in each request
- Inline base64: encode and include directly in the message block

### ✅ Correct Answer

**Message Batches API: submit all requests in one batch call, poll for completion**

### Technical Reasoning

This is a high-volume, offline workload involving thousands of independent requests.

The Message Batches API is specifically designed for this scenario.

Benefits:

- Submit thousands of requests together
- Lower per-token cost
- Avoid synchronous rate-limit issues
- Better scalability
- Asynchronous processing designed for bulk workloads

### Why the Other Options Are Wrong

#### ❌ Files API

The Files API addresses file storage and reuse. It does not help process thousands of requests more efficiently.

#### ❌ Inline base64

Inline base64 only determines how data is attached to a request. It does not solve rate-limit concerns, scaling concerns, or bulk-processing requirements.

### Key Learning

> High-volume offline workloads should use the Message Batches API rather than thousands of synchronous API calls.

---

# Summary Table

| Scenario | Correct Answer | Reason |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Reference product diagram used repeatedly | Files API | Upload once and reuse via `file_id` to avoid repeated uploads. |
| One-off UI bug screenshot | Inline base64 | Simple, single-use asset with no need for storage or reuse. |
| 5,000 customer feedback classifications | Message Batches API | Large-scale offline workload requiring asynchronous processing. |

---

# Decision Framework

Use the following rule of thumb when choosing between the three options:

```text
Need to reuse the same file across many requests?
    → Files API

Need to send a file only once?
    → Inline base64

Need to process thousands of requests offline?
    → Message Batches API
```

## Quick Comparison

| Method | Best For | Avoid When |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Files API | Frequently reused assets | One-time uploads |
| Inline base64 | Single-request assets | Repeated reuse of large files |
| Message Batches API | High-volume asynchronous workloads | Real-time user interactions |

### Final Rule

- **Reuse a file many times** → **Files API**
- **Use a file once** → **Inline base64**
- **Process thousands of requests offline** → **Message Batches API**
