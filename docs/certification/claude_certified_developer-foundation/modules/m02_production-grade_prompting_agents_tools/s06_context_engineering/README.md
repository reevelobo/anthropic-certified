# Context Engineering

# Model selection and keeping multi-turn sessions in budget
 
You make one early choice: which model runs the workload. The Claude family covers a range of cost, latency, and capability tradeoffs, so the model you pick sets the price and speed floor that every later decision moves within.
 
Once the model is set, the next constraint is the context window: the full span of text the model can take in at once, including your prompt, the conversation so far, and every tool result. Every tool result Claude returns gets appended to the context window and stays there for the rest of the session. In a single-turn prompt, that's invisible. In a multi-step agent session running ten or twenty tool calls, the window fills up fast, and once it fills, the agent either compacts (losing detail) or stalls before the task is done.
 
So, the question for any agent workflow is whether you've decided in advance what goes into the context window, what comes back out as a summary, and what never enters at all. That set of choices is context engineering.
 
## Model selection: Start with Sonnet, move deliberately
 
The Claude model family currently spans four tiers: Fable, Opus, Sonnet, and Haiku, each optimized for different cost, latency, and capability tradeoffs. Sonnet is the balanced default for most production workloads. Haiku is built for speed and cost efficiency on tasks that fit its capability envelope. Opus handles demanding work above the Sonnet envelope, and Fable is Anthropic's most capable model, built for the most demanding tasks including complex reasoning, advanced coding, research synthesis, and sophisticated agentic workflows where maximum intelligence is the priority. Confirm the current lineup and model identifiers against platform.claude.com/docs at build time.
 
The default starting point is Sonnet. Move up to Opus only when an eval set tells you Sonnet isn't meeting your quality bar. Move down to Haiku only when an eval set tells you the quality regression is acceptable at your task, not just to save costs. Your decision to move models should always be a measured decision.
 
## The context window is not a free resource
 
Think of the context window as the amount of space Claude can hold in working memory. Every message you send, every tool result you return, every document you inject, and every response Claude generates occupies space in that window. If a request is already larger than the context window, the Messages API rejects it with a validation error before generation; if a request fits but generation reaches the ceiling partway, current models return the output generated so far with a model_context_window_exceeded stop reason. Neither path silently truncates your oldest content. If you want a session to keep running past the window limit, your application must manage that itself by trimming or summarizing history before the next request goes out.
 
In development, the window rarely fills because test inputs are small and sessions are short. In production, tool outputs are often three to five times longer than test fixtures, sessions run for more turns, and the window fills at turn eight rather than turn fifty, which means they fill earlier than development. The cost of not planning for this is a production outage.
 
## Four strategies for staying in budget
 
The previous section made the case for moving state out of the live context window. The reason behind that is the budget. Every token in the window costs money on input and adds latency to the response, and a long session compounds both. The four strategies below are concrete ways to manage that budget, each suited to a different shape of conversation.
 
| Strategy | What it does | When to apply | What continuity you lose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Pruning | Lets you jump back to an earlier message and continue from there, removing the conversation that came after. | After Claude has gone down an unproductive path or accumulated debugging back-and-forth that won't help the next task. | The work done after the rewind point is gone. If Claude learned something useful in that stretch, it has to relearn it. |
| Compaction (/compact in Claude Code; server-side compaction in the API, a beta strategy the platform performs for you, with manual summarization as the client-side alternative) | Summarizes the conversation history into a condensed version that preserves the key information Claude has learned. The summary costs fewer tokens than the original turns. | When the session is approaching the context ceiling but you want to keep working on the same feature with the knowledge Claude has built up. | Details can be lost in the summarization. Anything not captured in the summary will not be available to Claude going forward. |
| Clearing (/clear in Claude Code; new session in API) | Starts a new conversation with empty context. Nothing from the previous session carries forward. | When the next task is completely different from the current one, and previous context would only introduce bias or confusion. | All session context is gone. Anything Claude needs to remember across sessions has to be put somewhere persistent, like a CLAUDE.md file. |
| Subagent Handoffs | Spawns a subagent in its own isolated context window with only the task description and system prompt it needs. The subagent does the work and returns a summary. | When a subtask is self-contained enough to delegate, especially exploration work where the journey clutters the main context but the answer is short. | Visibility into how the subagent reached its conclusion. The intermediate steps are discarded with the subagent's context. |
 
## Two more levers: prompt caching and token counting
 
The four strategies above manage what enters the context window. Two API features reduce what you pay for what's already there.
 
Prompt caching stores the processing work done on a stable prefix of your request so follow-up requests can reuse it instead of reprocessing the same tokens. The first request writes the prefix to cache; subsequent requests that send identical content up to that point pay a fraction of the original cost. The strongest candidates are parts of the request that rarely change across turns: a long system prompt, a large tool definition set, or a reference document you query repeatedly. You enable caching by marking a cache breakpoint with a cache_control field of type ephemeral on the last block you want cached. You can place up to four breakpoints. For multi-turn sessions with a stable system prompt and tool schemas, caching those prefixes once and reusing them across turns is the highest-leverage cost reduction available.
 
Token counting lets you measure context pressure before a request goes out rather than after it fails. The count_tokens endpoint takes the same request body as a messages call and returns the token count without running inference. Use it during development to verify your context budget assumptions hold against real tool outputs, not just test fixtures, and in production to gate requests that would exceed the window before they error.
 
## The three places a RAG path can break
 
The path has three places where it can go wrong: the chunking, the embedding match, and the assembly into the prompt.
 
- Chunking decides what a unit of retrievable context is. Split too small and a single chunk lacks the surrounding context to be useful. Split too large and one chunk dilutes the match with unrelated text. Sentence-based or section-based chunking with a little overlap is a reasonable default. The overlap matters because facts that cross a boundary would otherwise be split apart and become difficult to retrieve.
- The embedding match decides which chunks are returned. It uses a similarity search, so it retrieves content that is semantically close. This is not always what contains the exact term you need. A query for a specific identifier can miss the relevant chunk if a more semantically similar result outranks it. This is why a lexical match is sometimes run alongside the semantic one.
- The assembly step is where retrieved chunks must reach the model in the structure the prompt expects, otherwise the model answers from memory instead of from the retrieved text.
The fetch-once path gives you a system you can reason about: you can inspect which chunks were retrieved for a query and test that retrieval directly. The cost is the infrastructure: the index that must be built, stored, kept in sync as the corpus changes, and secured wherever it lives. The search-across-rounds path removes that infrastructure and the staleness that comes with it, since the model reads the current files at query time, at the cost of spending more tokens and time per query and giving you a less inspectable process. For a stable reference corpus queried with simple lookups, the index is worth owning. For a changing corpus or multi-step questions, the iterative search is usually the simpler system despite costing more per query.
 
The reported performance gain for single-agent agentic search over a retrieval index is a version-pinned figure. Confirm it against the reference layer at build time rather than relying on the number in this module.
 
Now, let's understand a bit about two of the most common strategies: compaction and subagent handoffs.
 
## Applying compaction: What gets preserved depends on how you write the summarizer
 
When you use /compact in Claude Code, the tool decides what to include in the summary. In the API, the documented primary strategy is server-side compaction (beta): the platform summarizes the conversation for you when it is configured on the request. When you instead implement manual compaction in an API session, you write the summarizer prompt yourself. That prompt determines what the agent will know in subsequent turns.
 
Summarizer prompt says "summarize the conversation so far"
 
Summarizer prompt says "summarize the conversation, preserving all file paths modified, all decisions made, and any errors encountered and their resolutions"
 
This is not an edge case; task-critical state loss from an under-specified summarizer is one of the most common sources of multi-session agent failures.
 
## Subagent handoffs: Managing long-horizon tasks
 
When a task is too large for a single context window, increasing the window is not a solution. The solution is to decompose the task and pass only the relevant context to each subagent. A subagent receives a scoped task and the minimum context it needs, the results of prior steps that are directly relevant, the tools it needs to complete its task, and clear exit conditions. The parent agent collects the results. This pattern keeps per-turn cost low and makes long-horizon tasks tractable.
 
Like compaction and pruning, subagent handoffs add implementation overhead, so apply them only where context cost is a real constraint: a simple single-turn prompt or short workflow doesn't need this.
 
### Handles well
 
Multi-step agent sessions that exceed the token budget and need decomposition. Best designed at the architecture stage rather than patched in as a production fix.
 
### Use a different approach
 
Pipelines that never approach the window limit. Measure actual token usage against your model's context limit before adding management overhead.
 
## Forward pointer
 
The strategies covered so far assume you know your context budget is under pressure and you are choosing a tool to manage it. The critical point here is not to know the pressure exists until the session breaks. A workload can pass every test in development and then fail in production for one reason: the tool output got bigger, the sessions got longer, and the context window that held twenty turns cleanly now fills at turn eight. The next section walks through exactly how that happens, using a worked postmortem of an agent that ran fine on test fixtures and then hit its ceiling once real documents started flowing through it.

The strategies covered so far assume you know your context budget is under pressure and you are choosing a tool to manage it. The critical point here is not to know the pressure exists until the session breaks. A workload can pass every test in development and then fail in production for one reason: the tool output got bigger, the sessions got longer, and the context window that held twenty turns cleanly now fills at turn eight. The next section walks through exactly how that happens, using a worked postmortem of an agent that ran fine on test fixtures and then hit its ceiling once real documents started flowing through it.
 
 # The session that ran fine in development, then hit a ceiling in production
 
## Setup
 
Tool outputs consume context the same way prompts and file reads do. The context window is a fixed budget that holds everything Claude needs to see on a given turn: the system prompt, the conversation history, and every tool call and tool result accumulated so far. When tool outputs are short, each turn adds a small amount to that running total and the budget lasts a long time. When tool outputs grow larger, each turn adds more to the same running total, and the budget runs down faster. The window itself has not changed; what changed is how much of it each turn now spends. A session that handles twenty turns cleanly in development can start failing at turn eight in production for exactly this reason.
 
## Postmortem: Context budget never measured against production tool outputs
 
An agent was built to process sales receipts under a 40k context window token budget, a cap the team set as a cost control on the agent's context rather than the model's ceiling. The model itself offered far more room. Current Claude API models carry at least a 200k-token context window, and the newest flagship models, Fable included, serve 1M tokens by default, so the 40k figure was a deliberate budget the team imposed, not a limit the model forced on them. Development used a test fixture set of twenty receipts, each returning a tool result of roughly 800 tokens. The full twenty-turn session consumed about 18,000 tokens, well within the team's 40k token budget limit.
 
In production, receipts contained supporting documentation, including transaction records, and correspondence. Average tool output grew to approximately 3,200 tokens per call. Eight turns of tool output alone added up to roughly 25,600 tokens, and once the system prompt, user messages, and assistant messages were added on top, the running total reached the team's 40k budget cap. The agent hit that cap at turn eight, before it could complete its analysis. The failure looked like degraded tool selection because the agent started choosing the wrong tools and returning incomplete analyses. However, the underlying cause was different. The system prompt and early instructions had been crowded out by accumulated tool outputs that were never pruned after use, and the agent was making decisions on a context window that no longer contained the guidance it had started with.
 
|  | Development | Production |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Context window available | 200k standard, 1M on current Opus and Sonnet | 200k standard, 1M on current Opus and Sonnet |
| Team budget cap | 40k tokens | 40k tokens |
| Avg. tool output | ~800 tokens per call | ~3,200 tokens per call |
| Turns before window fills | Sessions completed without reaching the cap | Cap reached at turn 8 |
| Observed symptom | None. Sessions complete cleanly | Wrong tool selections and incomplete outputs starting turn 8 |
| Root cause identified by | Not applicable | Token usage audit, two days after deployment |
| Fix | Not applicable | Prune tool outputs after use, and apply compaction proactively before the cap is reached |
 
## What to Watch Out for
 
The development test fixtures were shorter than production data. This is true for almost every agent built against a fixture set. The fix is to measure the actual token cost of a tool result against the largest input you can find in your target data before the agent ships.
 
The symptom of context overflow is often misread as a tool selection failure, because the output looks similar. If you see tool selection degrade after a fixed number of turns, check whether the context window is filling before you start debugging the schema.
