# Key takeaways

## 01. Package while the build is fresh.

An accelerator keeps the reusable logic, exposes the customer-specific parts as documented parameters, and bundles the eval and the audit log alongside the asset.

Correct packaging produces an asset teams configure.

The knowledge of what is customer-specific is most expensive to reconstruct after the people who held it have moved on.

---

## 02. A maintainer accepts what they can verify.

Moving an asset into shared infrastructure means matching it to the channel built for its shape, then clearing the review bar:

- Focused code
- A runnable example
- A test
- A statement of assumptions

Licensing rights must be confirmed before the technical review.

A contribution a reviewer cannot verify sits at the back of the queue.

Readiness moves a private asset into shared infrastructure others build on.

---

## 03. Pin what ships.

Choose the deployment platform based on the customer's cloud and compliance posture, then pin the specific model version rather than the moving alias and keep the prior version available.

An alias is like asking for the current edition of a book: convenient, but the text can change.

Pinning cites a fixed edition, so an upstream model change is something you adopt deliberately rather than something that arrives overnight with no rollback path.

---

## 04. Measure the dimension that decides the placement.

A platform choice is defensible only when latency, compliance, and cost are measured:

- Latency from the customer's region
- Compliance against their existing certification
- Cost as the total per call rather than the token price alone

For regulated customers, compliance is usually pass-or-fail.

Raising compliance as a constraint during scoping prevents it from rejecting the build later at contract review.

---

## 05. Mark every seam as a boundary.

A multi-component application is only as contained as its most privileged seam.

Scope each component to the minimum access its role requires and treat every point where data crosses as a trust boundary.

Fetched content is treated as data, not instructions.

Trust at a component boundary must be explicitly established. It does not carry over from the component that sent the data.

When a seam cannot be secured, it goes to a human owner rather than being shipped.

---

# What comes next

You can now package a build into a reusable asset, contribute it back, place and version it on the right platform, defend that placement, and connect components together so the boundaries hold.

That completes the build-to-deploy arc for this persona: from writing production code in the earlier modules to shipping assets a regulated customer can audit and a team can reuse.

You can now take a working build all the way to a deployable, auditable asset.

**Package it, contribute it, place and version it, defend that placement, and hold the boundaries together under review.**

## Glossary
# Key terms from this module

*Alphabetical. Click a term to expand its definition.*

## Accelerator

A working solution packaged so the next engagement configures it rather than rebuilding it.

Customer-specific parts are exposed as documented parameters, the assumptions are written down, and an eval is bundled to prove the asset still works in a new context.

---

## Contribution readiness

What a maintainer needs to verify a contribution:

- Focused code
- A runnable example
- A test that proves the behavior
- A statement of environment assumptions
- Confirmed rights to contribute the code

---

## Deployment platform

Where a Claude workload runs.

The six deployment platforms are:

1. First-party Claude API
2. Claude Platform on AWS
3. Claude in Amazon Bedrock
4. Claude on Amazon Bedrock (legacy)
5. Google Vertex AI
6. Third-party platforms

The same model can differ by platform on:

- Identity
- Data residency
- Latency
- Cost

---

## Model alias versus pinned ID

An alias such as `opus` or `sonnet` resolves to a recommended version that updates over time and can differ by platform.

A pinned full model ID is a fixed snapshot.

Pinning is what keeps an upstream model change from becoming a silent production change.

---

## Trust boundary

The seam where data or instructions move from one deployment environment to another in a multi-component application.

Content fetched by one component is untrusted when it reaches the next component, so the receiving component treats it as data, not instructions.
